# SRC Directory Deployment Guide for EKO Navigation Backend

## Issue Resolution

We've identified and resolved the deployment issues that were preventing your Render deployment. The main problem was that Render was expecting your code to be in a `src` directory, but your project structure didn't match this expectation.

## Changes Made

1. **Created a src directory** in the backend folder
2. **Moved source files** to the src directory:
   - server.js
   - routes directory
   - models directory
   - middleware directory
3. **Updated render.yaml** to reflect the new directory structure

## Current Configuration

### Build Command

```
npm install
```

### Start Command

```
node src/server.js
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit and push your changes** to your GitHub repository
2. **Go to Render** and create a new Web Service
3. **Connect your GitHub repository**
4. **Configure the service** with these settings:
   - Build Command: `npm install`
   - Start Command: `node src/server.js`
5. **Add these environment variables** in the Render dashboard:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_generated_jwt_secret
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

## Verification

Before deploying, we verified that:

- The server.js file works correctly when run directly from the src directory
- The server starts on port 5000
- MongoDB connects successfully
- Health check endpoint returns proper JSON response
- API routes are properly registered and responding

## Expected Outcome

With these changes, your Render deployment should now work correctly. The deployment should show:

- "Build successful ðŸŽ‰"
- Application running without module resolution errors
- Server listening on the correct port

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Check that all files were committed and pushed to GitHub
2. Verify that the src directory and its contents exist in the backend directory
3. Ensure all environment variables are set in the Render dashboard
4. Check Render logs for any additional error messages

The deployment should now complete successfully.
