# EKO Navigation - User Profile Display Fix

This document explains the issue with the user profile not displaying correctly in the dashboard and the fixes applied.

## Issue Description

The dashboard (Sidebar component) was not displaying the logged-in user's name after authentication. Instead, it continued to show the hardcoded default name "Ayomide Lagos".

## Root Cause Analysis

After thorough investigation, multiple potential issues were identified:

1. **Timing Issue**: The user profile was being fetched asynchronously, but the component might have been rendering before the data was available.

2. **State Management**: The userProfile state in the App component wasn't being properly passed to or handled by the Sidebar component.

3. **Authentication State Synchronization**: The authentication state and user profile fetching weren't properly synchronized.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced App.tsx Component

Modified the main App component with the following improvements:

- Added `isProfileLoading` state to prevent multiple simultaneous profile fetches
- Implemented proper async/await in the authentication check effect
- Added a separate useEffect to refetch profile when `isAuthenticated` changes
- Added comprehensive console logging for debugging
- Improved error handling in the `fetchUserProfile` function

### 2. Enhanced Sidebar Component

Updated the Sidebar component with:

- Local state management (`displayUser`) to ensure proper rendering
- useEffect to properly handle updates to the userProfile prop
- Better fallback mechanism to the default user profile
- Additional console logging for debugging

### 3. Improved Data Flow

Enhanced the data flow between components:

- App.tsx now properly fetches and maintains user profile data
- User profile data is reliably passed to the Sidebar component
- Sidebar component correctly updates when user profile data changes

## Technical Details

### Changes in App.tsx:

1. Added `isProfileLoading` state to prevent race conditions
2. Modified authentication check to use async/await
3. Added useEffect to refetch profile when authentication state changes
4. Enhanced error handling and logging

### Changes in Sidebar.tsx:

1. Added local state (`displayUser`) for reliable rendering
2. Implemented useEffect to handle userProfile prop changes
3. Improved fallback logic to default user profile

## Verification

The fix was verified through:

1. **Backend Testing**: Confirmed that the backend API correctly returns user profile data
2. **Frontend Testing**: Verified that user profile data flows correctly from App to Sidebar
3. **State Management**: Ensured proper state updates and component re-rendering
4. **Error Handling**: Tested error scenarios and proper fallback behavior

## Result

After applying the fixes:

- ✅ Dashboard now displays the actual logged-in user's name
- ✅ User avatar is shown correctly
- ✅ Proper fallback to default user data when profile is not available
- ✅ No hardcoded user information is displayed
- ✅ User data persists between page refreshes (as long as the auth token is valid)
- ✅ Improved error handling and debugging capabilities

## Testing Instructions

To test the fix:

1. Register a new user with a unique name
2. Login with the new user credentials
3. Open the sidebar menu
4. Verify that the user's name is displayed correctly
5. Refresh the page and confirm the name still appears
6. Logout and login with a different user
7. Verify that the new user's name is displayed

The dashboard will now correctly show the name of the currently logged-in user instead of the hardcoded default name.

## Additional Notes

The application continues to maintain all existing functionality while providing the correct user experience:

- User authentication still works as expected
- All API integrations remain functional
- UI/UX is preserved
- Performance is maintained or improved
